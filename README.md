# blackjack-terminal
This project is a clean, logic-driven implementation of Blackjack (21). It was developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming in Python, specifically focusing on class interactions and state management. The game handles complex card logic, such as dynamic Ace valuation and dealer AI, providing a seamless experience directly in the command line.
